# Linear Regression from Scratch

Implementation of linear regression algorithms from scratch in Python.

## Features

- Two implementations:
  - Normal Equation (closed-form solution)
  - Gradient Descent (iterative optimization)
- Handles various input formats (lists, arrays)
- Comprehensive test suite
- Example usage scripts with visualization

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linear-regression-from-scratch.git
cd linear-regression-from-scratch
pip install .
